BAD CODE PROBLEMS:
==================
- can walk through walls at borders
  - sprites/slime.py:37-57

- shitty going into rooms
  - sprites/slime.py:43,56
  - ui/overworld_ui.py:80-90

- hats
  - $$$$$

- Room vs RoomDS
  - ui/map_ui.py:19
  - terrain/__init__.py:9

- We never use the Tile class: do we need to?
  - terrain/__init__.py:4

- entities crossing borders sometimes invisible
  - can be seen sometimes with the Lightning Elementals
  - solution is probably to pour all entities into a global set which is drawn last
  - terrain/__init__.py:47

- "impassible" needs more precision
  - for instance, the walls in the house
  - terrain/rooms.py:15
  - sprites/slime.py:37-57

- entities probably shouldn't be acting on a per-reblit schedule
  - terrain/__init__.py:48

- room loading should be threaded
  - ui/overworld_ui.py:24
