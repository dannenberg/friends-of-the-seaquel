- dungeons
  - puzzles
  - combat
  - random
    - preconstructed rooms, strategically placed to create dungeon
    - random puzzles are hard
    - eg: have 10 puzzles, use 4

- overworld
  - finite
  - random
  - mini-dungeons, on the overworld?
    - less puzzle based
  - random inconspicuous bomb-walls/burn-bush
  - upgrade pond
  - different areas
    - town
    - grasslands
    - forest
    - ocean?
    - desert
    - etc

- items
  - have upgrades
  - diablo-style adjectives, modifiers on the items
    - puzzles are all doable with the item, but the stats are different
    - encourages different play styles between worlds
  - spells might be rolled into this, but i don't know that i like spells being obtained from dungeons

- enemy combatants
  - some of them should be way easier to take down with multiple people
    - i don't think any simple enemies should be impossible to take down solo
  - focus on complex strategies, like removing armor or whatever, more than just "shoot at weak spot" (for bosses esp.)

- death/respawning
  - health is just HPs like standard.
  - 0 hps means you are dead: your corpse sits there on the ground and you watch a grayed-out screen
  - if you...
    - hit the respawn button...
      - in a dungeon you are transported to the entrance
        - combat rooms shut all exits, ensuring people cannot reenter the room until the battle is over. puzzles can be rejoined.
      - on the overworld you are transported to the last town you visited
    - wait on this screen you may be rezzed by another player's ability.
      - a cleric skill would bring you back for a high MP price
      - a necromancer skill would bring you back as a zombie, with different stats etc
      - at some point a timer would just respawn you and your corpse would disappear

- world events
  - flooding the world
  - reseting dungeons?

- multiplayer
  - minecraft-ish in style:
    - server is up, anyone can join and make progress in the overworld solo
    - dungeons require x people to complete, specified at the start of the dungeon
      - dungeon is either locked until x people are present or is just suggested
    - rewards are all the same item, different enchantments
      - one per player
    - Handling completed dungeons:
      1: dungeon is reset on completion
        - everyone present gets an end-of-dungeon reward and is ejected to the overworld
        - dungeon immediately resets state
        - veterans may replay the dungeon but will not receive further rewards
        - new players may replay and reap the rewards
      2: dungeon is able to be reset manually
        - similar conditions to above
      3: first come, first serve
        - dungeon will be a hollow husk of its former glory
        - new players may scavenge for the item of the dungeon
        - end-of-dungeon reward for new players is questionable
          - don't want to just give it away
          - boss may respawn?
        - possible all rooms reset but the keyed doors remain open
          - this makes the run much easier but not trivial: enemies and many puzzles are still mandatory
